# Number-Guessing-Game
This repository contains a simple number guessing game implemented in JavaScript. The game generates a random number between a specified range and prompts the user to guess the number. The user receives feedback if their guess is too high or too low until they guess the correct number. The number of attempts taken to guess correctly is also displayed.

Features:

Random Number Generation: A random number between a specified range (1 to 100) is generated at the start of the game.

User Interaction: The user is prompted to guess the number and receives feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Attempts Counter: The number of attempts taken to guess the correct number is tracked and displayed.
